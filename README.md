# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Con, a hobbyist Web Dev, primarily using Javascript, and playing with Typescript. I'm also highly active on Discord and am working on [Zen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvz7nTbS_C0), a multi-purpose, open source Discord Bot. I like making things, especially things that help or entertain others. When I'm not on Discord, you can find me cycling, coding, or watching Netflix.
